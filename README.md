# Week-3-Challenge-Random-Password-Generator
Week 3 Challenge - Random Password Generator Project

## Random Password Generator
* Week 3's Challenge requires us to modify a starter code to create an application powered by Javascript that enables users to create a random password based on desired criteria. 
### Challenge Goals
* Present series of prompts for password critieria:
    * Uppercase, Lowercase, Numeric, and/or Special
    * Length of password
    * All selected critierias generated
* Generates password on page
* Once code base is complete we will have to deploy the application to a live URL and Github URL with new repository that satisfies repository criterias.
